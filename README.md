## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following essential files:

### Data Files

- **`jared_goff_history.csv`**: Contains historical performance data for Jared Goff, including passing yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and other relevant metrics across multiple seasons.
- **`nfl_team_statistics.csv` & `nfl_team_statistics.txt`**: Provide detailed statistical data for NFL teams, including offensive and defensive metrics that influence the quarterback's performance.
- **`schedule.csv`**: Lists the upcoming games on the schedule, including opponent details and game locations, which are critical for predictive modeling.
- **`jared_goff_predicted_stats.csv`**: The output file containing predicted statistics for Jared Goff based on the analysis.

### Script Files

- **`goff.py`**: The main Python script responsible for data processing, feature extraction, model training, and performance prediction.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to set up a Python environment with the necessary packages. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nfl-quarterback-prediction.git
   cd nfl-quarterback-prediction



## Analysis Methodology

The analysis follows a structured approach to ensure accurate and reliable predictions:

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves:

- Removing or imputing missing values.
- Normalizing data to ensure consistency.
- Filtering out irrelevant data points that do not contribute to the prediction model.

### Feature Engineering

Key features are engineered from the raw data, including:

- **Opponent Strength**: Calculated based on the opposing team's defensive metrics.
- **Home/Away Indicator**: Binary feature indicating whether the game is played at home or away.
- **Recent Performance**: Weighted averages of Goff's recent games, highlighting trends in his performance.

### Model Training

A machine learning model (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or a more complex model) is trained on the historical data. The model is validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure its generalizability to new data.

### Prediction

The trained model is used to predict Jared Goff's performance for upcoming games. The predictions are then saved to `jared_goff_predicted_stats.csv`, where each row represents a game, and each column represents a predicted metric (e.g., passing yards, touchdowns).

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from multiple reliable sources:

- **Jared Goff Historical Data**: Sourced from NFL statistics databases, this data includes comprehensive metrics on Jared Goff's performance over several seasons.
- **NFL Team Statistics**: Collected from public NFL data repositories, this dataset provides team-level statistics, offering insights into how team performance might impact individual player stats.
- **Game Schedule**: The schedule was extracted from the official NFL schedule, including details on game locations and opponents.
